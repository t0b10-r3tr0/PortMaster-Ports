## HOW TO INSTALL:

- If you have an older version, it is recommended you uninstall it first.
- Copy the game's data into ports/tmntsr/gamedata
- Run the game and wait, first launch converts a lot of files, so it takes ~15minutes.
- This happens only once.

## GET GAME DATA

### Steam Windows

1. On your PC, press Win+R and type: `steam://open/console` (Steam will now show console command). For best results do this command with Steam closed.
2. In the Steam console, type: `download_depot 1361510 1361511`
3. For the DLC type: `download_depot 1361510 2348930` (you must have purchased it for it to work)
4. It’ll take about 20 minutes to download, the game files will be in the directory that is printed out.

### Steam macOS

1. Make sure steam is running, then type `steam://open/console` in Safari.
2. In the Steam console, type: `download_depot 1361510 1361511`
3. For the DLC type: `download_depot 1361510 2348930` (you must have purchased it for it to work)
4. It’ll take about 20 minutes to download, but then it will show you a path to where the folder is located. It’s pretty deep in the MacOS file system, the easiest way to do that is through the Library folder. Open a new Finder window, press `cmd + shift + g` and a window will appear, paste the location that steam gave you a few moments earlier.
