In this directory, you will provide the game data for the titles you have. The 
The required game data must come from the linux version of either the Steam or
GOG version of the game. Ensure you are providing the linux version of the game
data.

For Steam, instructions can be found here:

Here is the current directory structure within gamedata:

gamedata
├─ shovelofhope
├─ specteroftorment
├─ kingofcards
├─ shovelknightshowdown



For each of the standalone games you have (linux version only), you will have
to locate and copy the directories '32', '64', and 'data' into the appropriate
location. They must reside in the named directory for the game.

(within shovelkknight-se directory)

gamedata
├── "gamename" 
     ├── *32
     ├── *64
     ├── *data

(directories with "*" are provided by user from game files)



For example, if you had most of the games (except Plague of Shadows and King of Cards), your directory
structure will look like this:

gamedata
├── shovelofhope
│    ├── *32
│    ├── *64
│    ├── *data
├── specteroftorment
│    ├── *32
│    ├── *64
│    ├── *data
├── kingofcards (empty, no game files provided)
├── shovelknightshowdown
     ├── *32
     ├── *64
     ├── *data

(directories with "*" are provided by user)



Do not place files in the directories for the games you don't have (unless you
want to confuse the detection logic and make things blow up).

Enjoy
