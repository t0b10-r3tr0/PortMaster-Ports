## Additional Content

This port supports the addition of official or community-created episodes/mods and you can add additional content to Commander Genius in one of two ways:

1. **Manually**: You can add load your own game files into the following location, relative to your ports directory: `cgenius/conf/.CommanderGenius/games`. If you opt to load the game files manually, ensure that you update the `games.cfg` within the mentioned directory appropriately.

2. **Automatically**: If you have an internet connection on-device, you can simply download content directly from the launcher (button on bottom-left) to access additional community created content. Downloading content from the launcher will automatically update your `games.cfg` file, mentioned just above.
