     ===================

     Playing the Game
     ----------------

     Now we'll cover all the actions you can do in the game (the keys mentioned
     are the defaults).  Commander Keen can:

     RUN LEFT/RIGHT  Use the [left] and [right] arrow keys to move.

     JUMP  Press [Ctrl] to make Keen jump.  (This is Button 1 in joystick
     control.)

     POGO  Press [Alt] to use your pogo stick.  You can jump higher with it, 
     but it is harder to control.  Press [Alt] again to stop using it.  (This
     is button 2 in joystick control.)

     SHOOT  Press [space] (or [Ctrl] and [Alt] if you chose Two-Button Firing)
     to fire your Neural Stunner.  It will fire in the direction you are facing.

     ENTER  If you are standing in front of a doorway, pressing the up arrow
     will enter the door.

     CLIMB POLE  Press [up] or [down] when in front of a pole to get on it and
     shinny up or slide down the pole.  If you press [right] or [left], you 
     will swing around to face that side.  You can get off the pole quickly by
     pressing [Ctrl].

     GRAB ONTO EDGE  You can jump and grab onto the edge of a surface.  Press
     [up] or the direction toward the surface you want to be upon ([left] or 
     [right]) to pull yourself up.  If you push [down] or the arrow away from 
     that surface, you'll fall down.

     FLIP SWITCH  The switches on Fribbulus Xax are rather large, so you must
     jump up into them, or down on top of them.

     LOOK UP/LOOK DOWN  Press and hold [up] or [down] to see more of the level
     in that direction.  This is very helpful when you don't think there is
     anything to jump onto.  Some hidden things might be revealed by looking up
     or down.

     DROP DOWN  If you are on a platform or narrow floor, you can drop down by
     holding [down] and pressing the jump key [Ctrl].

     OPEN DOOR  Doors need gem-shaped crystals to be placed in their gem
     holders.  To place the gem in the holder, just get the gem and walk up to
     it.

     To finish a level, you will need to either leave the level by the Exit sign
     (if there is one), or find the important object in the level.  For
     instance, the First Dome of Darkness contains something that you need to
     climb the cliff.

     BOSS KEY  You can make the game screen disappear instantly by pressing
     [F9].  Press [Esc] to get back to the game.

     Tons of bonus items and secret rooms are hidden in the game.  Explore the
     levels thoroughly!








     Advanced Moves
     --------------

     There are some moves that can get you to those ``impossible-to-get-to''
     places.  Here they are:

     IMPOSSIBLE POGO TRICK  If you run left or right, then quickly press Pogo
     [Alt] and Jump [Ctrl] in succession, you blast off at an angle.  This move
     may be nearly impossible if you use two-button firing.

     MID-AIR POGO  You can pull out your pogo stick in the middle of a normal
     jump, giving you good control for that first jump.

     SHOOT DOWN  You can jump over a monster and shoot it from above by 
     pressing [down] and fire [space].  You can also shoot upward or while
     climbing poles.

     FAST POLE CLIMBING  You can climb poles faster by holding [up], and
     pressing jump [Ctrl] repeatedly.  It may take some practice, but it's 
     worth it.

     COOL JUMPS  In many places you will see a big arc of candy.  These are
     usually set up so you can get them in one jump.  There is one on the first
     hill of the first level: try to pogo through all the ice cream bars there,
     while simultaneously jumping over the Bloog.



     HAVE FUN!
